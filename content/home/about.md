# Biography

I am a biomechanist interested in the impact of lateral bicycle sway and rider center of mass motion on cycling performance. I have a passion for optimizing athletic performance, having previously worked as a strength and conditioning coach and performance analyst. Iâ€™m also an avid cyclist with a healthy addiction to espresso coffee.
