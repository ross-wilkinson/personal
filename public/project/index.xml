      <description>THE EFFECT OF LATERAL BICYCLE SWAY AND RIDING POSTURE ON MECHANICAL EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY IN CYCLING
Cyclists often spontaneously switch from a seated to non-seated position when they need to produce high pedal torque and power (i.e. during steep climbs, accelerations and sprinting). Existing evidence shows that adopting a non-seated position can improve uphill time trial performance and increase peak power output during sprint cycling, yet the mechanisms underpinning these performance advantages remain unclear.</description>
